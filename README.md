# about me

Hi!! Im kravataf.. I make games, mods, tutorials and other stuff related to coding. I currently mainly use engine called Gdevelop 5.
I code mainly in Javascript but i also know a bit of C#, Java, (and i tried using C++) (not that im remotely good at them or anything). Im not sure what else i would add here :p

# current projects

Cave World Online (3D multiplayer Minecraft clone made in Gdevelop 5)

# tools i like

Gdevelop 5 (low/no-code, open-source 2d + 3d engine)

VS code

Mcreator (modding mc but im too lazy to learn java properly)

Blockbench (blender but for mc mods or general lowpoly models)

JS (the best programming language)
